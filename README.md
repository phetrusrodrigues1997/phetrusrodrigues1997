### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have just graduated with a first class degree in computer science. The plan is to master back end software development (Let's see how that goes lol). I have a love/hate relationship with: 

âœ¨Java/C# (Over a year)

âœ¨SQL (Over a year)

âœ¨Python (6 months)

(P.s) Don't judge my github files just yet, I am a noob. Please give me a few years (Written on 1 August, 2022)
